### Exploring rustc's most spectacular fails!

In this repository you can find the most spectacular (and fun!) rustc fails, and vote for your favorite one!

### Vote for a fail

Head over to the [issues section](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o/ferrisnomicon/issues) to find some super fun fails, and use the available emojis to show your support! :thumbsup: :heart: For your information, only positive emojis will be counted, and :rocket: will count as positive as well :D

### Submit a fail

Triggered a spectatular error message? Head over to the issues section and [Submit it!](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o/ferrisnomicon/issues/new)

We would like to make the contest as fun as possible, and hopefully useful for the Rust compiler teams, It would be amazing if Contestants could submit issues providing:

- A screenshot of the fail
- The version of rustc that triggered the error (it's the output of `rustc --version`)

- A (hopefully small) reproducible code sample
- Bonus points if there's a link to the rust playground!
